<h1>V-arc!!</h1>
    
<h2>(comment out later: Vhromium (formerly known as V-arc. v-arc is cooler. I think I'll just name it that. surely they won't sue me **clueless**))"</h2>

<h3>Our goal:</h3>
Make a browser as beautiful as arc and as simple as Vim.

<h3>Our motto:</h3>
Stolen from "still alive"<br>
"Aperture Science: We do what we must Because we can."<br> 
also <b>"Don't be evil."</b>

<h4>Funding model:</h4>
I'm in college. who cares about money.

<h4>Contributions:</h4>
just email me if you have ideas. github will be up soon. Once it's up I'll put a link at the top of the page. **clueless**<br>

<h4>Motive?</h4>
I really like the ideas of arc. They seem like cool people. I just want to make something similar but better.<br>
Hopefully down the line they'll release some developer tools for people like me. For people who don't want a whole bunch of features but still respect what they do.<br>
